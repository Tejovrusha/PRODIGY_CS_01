Task 01 â€“ Caesar Cipher

Cybersecurity Internship â€“ Prodigy InfoTech

ðŸ“Œ Overview

This repository contains my implementation of the Caesar Cipher, a classic encryption technique where each letter in the plaintext is shifted by a fixed number of positions in the alphabet.

This project was developed as part of Task 01 during my Cybersecurity internship at Prodigy InfoTech.

ðŸ›  Features

Encryption: Shifts plaintext characters to produce ciphertext.

Decryption: Reverses the shift to retrieve the original message.

Custom Shift Key: User-defined shift value for flexibility.

Case Preservation: Maintains uppercase and lowercase letters.

Non-Alphabet Support: Keeps symbols and numbers unchanged.
